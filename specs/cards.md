Cards
Users can add a Card to a List via a modal window (“Add new card”).


Each Card must contain: Name, Description, Due Date, Priority.


Each Card must also support an Assignee (selectable from the list of Users).


A Card can be edited or deleted via a context menu.


A Card can be moved to another List using the “Move to” dropdown.


Reassigning a Card to a different user must be logged in the Activity section.
