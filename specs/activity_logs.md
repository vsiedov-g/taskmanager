All changes to Cards must be recorded in the Activity Log: create, edit (name, description, due date, priority, assignee), move, delete.


Activity items are ordered by date/time (descending).


The History section initially loads the 20 latest records, with an option to load the next 20.


Each Activity record should also store the actor (the user who performed the action).
