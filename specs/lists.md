Lists
Users can create, edit, and delete a List.


When the board is empty, show a placeholder column with header “Add another list” and a “+” button.


Clicking “+” should create a new List with the ability to enter its Name.


Lists can be edited via a context menu; the Name becomes editable with Save/Cancel buttons.


When a List is deleted, all Cards within that List must also be deleted.


Each List header should display the number of Cards it contains.


Cards inside a List should be ordered primarily by Due Date (descending, nulls last), then by Priority (High → Low), and finally by CreatedAt (descending).


A placeholder “Add another list” with a “+” button should always be present at the end.
